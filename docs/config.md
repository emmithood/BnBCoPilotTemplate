This `.env` structure is a placeholder. Actual values will be injected per-client at deployment time.

Each client will receive their own:

- Azure OpenAI keys
- Supabase project + keys
- N8N webhook base URL

Use this structure to scaffold reusable `.env.template` files that get copied and populated per-client deployment.
