# AI Agents

Agents are task-specific AI workers that are triggered via buttons in the UI. Each one connects to an external N8N workflow via a webhook.

## ðŸ”§ Agent Interface

Each API route in `/api/agent/[agent]/route.ts`:

- Accepts a JSON POST body
- Sends the body to a predefined N8N webhook
- Returns the response from N8N to the frontend
- Logs the payload + result to `agent_logs`
