# STR AI Dashboard App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user or property manager accesses the STR AI Dashboard, they are met with a clean, modern landing page that immediately establishes the tool as a hub for automation. In this initial version, there is no user authentication, so users gain instant access by navigating directly to the dashboard URL or by using a dedicated Docker container link provided during deployment. Without a need for signing in, the landing page serves as an entry point that clearly displays the tool’s features and navigation options. The design ensures that anyone arriving at the dashboard understands the purpose of the app, even though traditional sign-up or sign-in processes, such as email registration or social login, are deliberately omitted in this MVP phase. This seamless entry avoids any credential requirements and provides a frictionless start-up experience.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon accessing the dashboard, the user is greeted with a visually appealing, ChatGPT-style interface that uses a modern card-based grid layout. The main view prominently features a left sidebar which offers clear and intuitive navigation through several key sections: AI Chat, AI Agents, Documents, and Contact Us. In the header area, users may see the application title and, if needed, notifications or system messages. The layout is built to be responsive, ensuring that whether viewed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, the content maintains its clarity and ease of use. The landing page also integrates subtle animations and interactive icons that hint at the dynamic nature of the tasks available, inviting the user to explore further into any of the specialized sections.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Navigating through the STR AI Dashboard is designed to feel natural and interconnected. When a user selects the AI Chat section from the left sidebar, they are presented with a chat interface that mimics popular conversational platforms. Here the user can type a question or issue into an input box. Behind the scenes, the text is embedded into a query which is then used to search through embedded document fragments stored in a Supabase database. The resulting document chunks are inserted into a call sent to Azure OpenAI for generating a contextual response. This answer is then neatly displayed within the chat window, making it feel like a real conversation with an intelligent assistant that references internal documentation and SOPs.

Switching to the AI Agents section, the user sees a collection of visually distinctive buttons, each representing a specific task such as rewriting a listing, generating an owner report, analyzing reviews, suggesting optimal pricing, planning maintenance, or automating guest messaging. Clicking on one of these buttons triggers a dynamic API call to the corresponding endpoint, typically formatted as `/api/agent/[agent]` where the agent’s name is appended, such as 'listing-rewrite' or 'owner-report'. The app then packages the user’s request into a payload that is sent to an external N8N webhook to perform the designated task. As soon as the external workflow completes, the result is displayed directly in the interface. For transparency and future reference, every agent reaction is logged to a dedicated table within Supabase, ensuring that actions can be audited or revisited if needed.

In the Documents section, users are provided with an interactive document management interface that supports file uploads for a variety of formats including text, markdown, PDF, and DOCX. The process is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly. After selecting the Documents tab, users can upload a file using a simple, drag-and-drop interface or a traditional file browser selection. Once a document is uploaded, it is automatically split into approximately 300-token chunks and embedded using OpenAI’s embedding API. The system stores these embeddings in the Supabase database and presents the user with a list of uploaded documents. The interface also provides functionality for deleting or managing documents as needed, ensuring that the documents available for AI Chat reference remain current and well-organized.

Additionally, the Contact Us section can be reached from the sidebar. Although less complex than the other sections, this page offers users an easy way to communicate feedback or reach support, ensuring users feel supported throughout their experience with the application.

## Settings and Account Management

Given that the current version of the STR AI Dashboard does not implement a traditional user authentication system, there is no separate account management or settings page where individual profiles, preferences, or billing information are maintained. Instead, the app’s configuration is largely predetermined through environment variables and deployment-specific Docker settings. In future releases that incorporate multi-user authentication and custom user settings, this area may evolve into a dedicated section. For now, any adjustments to system behavior or configuration are managed by developers or system integrators rather than the end user. After any administrative changes or on-screen feedback messages, users are smoothly redirected back into the main dashboard flow, ensuring that the overall journey remains uninterrupted.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the STR AI Dashboard, robust error handling ensures that users are clearly informed whenever something goes wrong. If a user submits a query in the AI Chat section and the system experiences a connectivity issue with Azure OpenAI or Supabase, an error message appears in the chat window detailing that the response could not be retrieved at that moment. In the AI Agents section, if an API call to an N8N webhook fails or returns an unexpected result, the system displays a concise error message in the area where the agent response would normally be shown. These messages often provide a suggestion to try again or to check connectivity. The same level of error feedback is maintained in the Documents section; if a file upload fails or if a document cannot be processed correctly, the user is notified immediately with information on what went wrong and, when possible, guidance on how to recover from the error. In all these cases, the design of the app ensures that users can quickly recover from error states through direct prompts or by simply retrying the action, all while maintaining a seamless visual flow and clear navigation back to the main interface.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The STR AI Dashboard creates a fluid experience that guides users from their initial entry point directly into the heart of the platform. Without the distraction of traditional authentication, users immediately engage with the dashboard’s primary functions upon landing on the page. Whether they are looking to ask questions in the AI Chat, run sophisticated tasks with various AI Agents, or manage and update important documents, every page and action flows seamlessly into the next. The application is designed with clear, intuitive navigation, responsive design, and integrated error handling to foster a trouble-free user journey. Ultimately, the STR AI Dashboard delivers on its promise of streamlining short-term rental management by offering quick access to intelligent automation, ensuring that every user interaction—from starting the app to executing task-specific actions—is simple, direct, and highly efficient.
