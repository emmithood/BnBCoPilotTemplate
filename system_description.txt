You are acting as an AI code generator for an MVP SaaS platform.

The MVP consists of:
- A client-specific dashboard
- Trigger buttons that call external N8N workflows (via webhooks)
- A chat assistant connected to Azure OpenAI (with basic RAG capabilities)
- Supabase for data (client-specific docs for embedding)
- A Dockerfile that allows the whole frontend/backend to be containerized

It does NOT need auth â€” one dashboard per client is deployed via Docker.
The dashboard must allow:
- Sending messages to a chatbot (backend proxies to Azure OpenAI)
- Triggering named webhooks for custom N8N agents
- Viewing response output in the UI (optional)

Use Next.js (with App Router) and Tailwind CSS for frontend.
Use Supabase and Azure OpenAI SDK for backend API endpoints.
